# Overview

Just some scripts I am using to compile [Cutlass](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass) examples directly.

I am trying to go through the Cutlass library's examples in a debugger, and it's crashing my own PC, so I have an instance rented on Vast.ai through which to do this work. This repo is so I can easily import the compilation scripts.

I am testing whether the debugger is crashing on the examples due to also rendering the GUI in the background. Maybe the drivers are buggy, but I have no choice but to try it on an isolated instance.
